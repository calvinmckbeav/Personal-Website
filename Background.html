        <h2>Background As To Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          This section is all who I am. I'll let you know a good amount about how I grew up and the people and places that've
          influenced my the most. I'm hoping that this gives you a helpful image of where I come from so that you can understand
          where I am now and where I'm going. To see the road ahead you must have first travelled the road behind you.

          <h3 class="uppercase">My Faith</h3>
          <p>
            In May 2021, I was baptized. This came after reading the bible consistently for almost a year and being involved with Northeastern's 
            catholic center. I was raised without any real faith, just considering myself agnostic all my life. After a few months of reading and talking to
            my close friend at the time (who is currently my beautfiul girlfriend) who grew up in the orthodox church, I kind of just found myself believing in Jesus 
            and feeling bad for the sins I've committed in my past. That was the day I knew I was Christian and began pursuing Christ ever since then.

          <h3 class="uppercase">My Family</h3>
          <p>
            I have a pretty small family. At home it was always just my parents, my older sister Megan, and I. My dad worked from
            home as a <a href="https://blogonkevin.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">freelance writer</a> so he was probably the most influential person of my whole life. Growing up my mom worked high up in
            Pepsi-Cola's human resources department. She worked long hours and went on a lot of business trips but towards the end of elementary school 
            she decided to switch to a smaller company where she could have more of an impact and also spend more time with our family.
            We also always had a pet dog. Before Megan and I were born my parents had a yellow lab named Kiner, but he passed when I was only about
            five years old. Then we had another yellow lab named Murphy who I absolutely loved. He was a real food shark but he was a great friend.
            He passed just before I started college last year, and since then we adopted a dog we named Dinger. He's smaller than Kiner and Murphy 
            and he's a real snuggler.

          <h3 class="uppercase">Where I've Lived</h3>
          <p>
            I was born in Dallas Texas in 2002. My family lived there only until I was two years old, then we moved 
            to the town my father grew up in, Stamford Connecticut. That's where I really grew up. Went through all of pre-k to high school there 
            until we moved again because of my mom's job in fall 2020. Now we live in <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andover,_Massachusetts" target="_blank">
            Andover Massachussetts</a> while I stay mostly in Boston for school.
