        <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
          <h3 class="uppercase">Why I Started</h3>
            <p>
              As stupid as it sounds, it was actually a class about Microsoft Excel that intrigued me to study computer science and coding. It was during my second 
              semester freshman year whiles tudying at Northeastern University. I started out as a Business Administrations/Economics combined major, which I only chose because 
              I had no real idea what I wanted to do for work. I did know that I really liked the microeconomics class I took in high school though, so I figured this program was broad enough
              I could have a lot of options for work after college and it incorporated economics which I knew I enjoyed. This mindset was the same second semester until I got the slightest 
              taste of programming with the excel class. At the time I was also taking Intro to Marketing which I strongly disliked the content of and caused me to reevaluate wanting to 
              study business entirely. These two classes combined into my decision to switch to the Computer Science/Economics program.

          <h3 class="uppercase">The Early Learning Stage</h3>
            <p>
              My first route of learning to code was on an app called Mimo in summer 2021. If you've ever used Duolingo to learn foreign languages, Mimo is almost identical but it's all for
              programming languages, primarily python, html, css, and javascript. I began with python since I heard it was really popular, and used it often on my breaks
              while I was working as a lifeguard. It was convenient to be able to learn on my phone anywhere and was a good introduction to syntax and the very basics of
              things like loops and such as someone completely new to programming, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone already with any programming experience 
              as it progresses pretty slowly and you have to start from the very beginning. <br>
              In that fall I began my first true computer science clas, Fundamentals of Computer Science 1. The class used a language called DrRacket, which while
              it isn't used for much else besides the class, they used it really well to teach us how to think like programmers. Here is where I was first exposed to concepts
              like lists, trees, recursion, abstraction, and local functions. I feel that the class was a great way to start really understanding what programming is. <br>

            <h3 class="uppercase">The next steps</h3>
            <p>
              While taking Fundies 1, I had the idea of creating a website I could use to learn web development skills, while also having a personal project that 
              can give future potential employers a better understanding of me and display the progress and other projects I've made. Thus I began to learn HTML using 
              CodeAcademy, used GitHub (linked below) to help keep track of what I've learned, and began coding this narcisstic website. CodeAcademy has felt more 
              productive than Mimo, it's helped me progress faster and been easier to apply what I've learned directly into creating my own code as opposed to 
              learning bit by bit from Mimo. <br>
